                <p>When you meet with our team - here's what you may experience:
                </p>
                <p>We will conduct a thorough assessment by asking several questions to determine the areas where you or your loved one may require assistance and identify the aspects of their daily life that are currently functioning well.

                </p>
                <p>Our team will also inquire about the common Activities of Daily living such as bathing, dressing, cooking, and moving from a chair or bed. We can then assess if these activities need support or can be performed independently.


                </p>
                <p>Our team will also work with you to determine the areas of your property that require attention, whether it's your garden or other aspects of your home. We'll also conduct a thorough inspection to identify any safety hazards, including trip hazards, and develop a plan to address them.</p>
                <p>At HALO, we believe that everyone deserves to live their life with purpose and dignity. That's why, after conducting a thorough assessment, we work closely with you to create a personalised service package that meets your unique needs and helps you maintain the independence and comfort of the home you love.</p>
