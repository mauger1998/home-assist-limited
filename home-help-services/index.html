                <p>When you meet with our head of care - here's what you may experience:
                </p>
                <p>We will conduct a thorough assessment by asking several questions to determine the areas where you, or your loved one may require assistance, as well as identify the aspects of their daily life that are currently functioning smoothly.

                </p>
                <p>We will inquire about the common Activities of Daily Living such as bathing, dressing, cooking, and moving from a chair or bed. They will assess whether these activities can still be performed independently or if support is needed.


                </p>
                <p>Once we have completed our assessment, we will propose care options based on any identified gaps or deficiencies. The home will be inspected to assess any safety hazards, including trip hazards around the house.</p>
